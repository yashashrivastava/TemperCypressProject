## TemperCypressProject

Cypress based project solution for Temper
I have designed a test automation framework using cypress and Page Object design for https://www.saucedemo.com/.
I have covered 3 tests (inside e2e folder) as per mentioned in the assignment 'Part 2 Test Automation exercise' as follows -->
Automation exercise: 
    1. Create a test to validate all possible login scenarios with all provided users. 
    2. Create a test to validate the end-to-end flow: you’re able to select a product, add it to 
your cart and successfully checkout. 
    3. Create a test to validate the filter ‘Price (low to high)’, is working properly. 


### To Run
Please run command "npx cypress run --browser chrome --headed" from terminal to run it on the chrome browser.
